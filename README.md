# SMK Wikrama Bogor – Unofficial Landing Page (Vue + Tailwind)

This is an **unofficial landing page** inspired by *SMK Wikrama Bogor*, built completely as a **personal learning project**. The school did **not** hire me, request this, or collaborate in any way.  
I made this purely to:

- learn and practice **Vue.js**  
- get better with **Tailwind CSS**  
- explore UI/UX decisions for a school-style landing page  
- build something nice for my frontend portfolio 

So yeah—this has **nothing to do with Wikrama itself**. Just me experimenting.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

### 1. To learn Vue in a real project  
I wanted something more fun than a basic CRUD app. This project uses:  
- component structure  
- reactive states  
- auto sliders  
- event listeners  
- intersection observers  
- layout challenges  
- responsive design

### 2. To show my frontend skillset  
It’s nice to have a visually complete, real-world landing page in my portfolio,  
instead of only small practice apps.
