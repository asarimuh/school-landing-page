# SMK Wikrama Bogor – Unofficial Landing Page (Vue + Tailwind)

This is an **unofficial landing page** inspired by *SMK Wikrama Bogor*, built completely as a **personal learning project**. The school did **not** hire me, request this, or collaborate in any way.  
I made this purely to:

- learn and practice **Vue.js**  
- get better with **Tailwind CSS**  
- explore UI/UX decisions for a school-style landing page
